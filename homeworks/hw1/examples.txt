"you can be fooled by your first impressions as in initial reactions to a movie for example as in the first time i saw this movie i was <unk> by the idea of it first of all i love black comedies could even despite being male myself empathise with the feisty girls fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay was tripped up by my own face value and i do mean face value response to <unk> sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture it just goes to show you that you 've got ta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it 's bad and not bad good either the reason i 'm giving this movie a 4 rating is because of ms sheridan and her <unk> the rest of er is pretty good too but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristics which means you 'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through and i 'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me and i"

"when you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old amitabh bachchan romances a <unk> old tabu wait in fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of <unk> it is the content that is <unk> in this <unk> turned writer director r. <unk> 's maiden effort .. <br /><br />trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise cracks and bitter sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half the locales of london as captured in rainy season are captivating by the end of first half romance completed and mission accomplished there is not much left to be said therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl 's father to the extent that he goes for a <unk> is really a test of patience there is an equally strange climax about how he gives in the result second half is dry flat with no energy there"

"i have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months i was actually surprised at how good it was.<br /><br />the plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named marty they constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves marty horribly <unk> /><br />a few years later the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party though not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />later through the film the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible i can certainly tell you that they are gory as well.<br /><br />at the end of the film you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened but marty is in the hospital with severe burns although the murders did n't happen the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />the acting is terrible but that is fine.<br /><br />i love the story i really sympathize with marty it 's like tamara 2005 the bullies get what 's coming to them in the end and you"

"i saw this film at the toronto international film festival not as salacious as it sounds this is a three part documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring <unk> superstar philosopher psychoanalyst slavoj zizek zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality it was directed by sophie fiennes of the multi talented fiennes clan she 's sister to actors ralph and <unk> /><br />i enjoyed this quite a bit although i think it will be even more enjoyable on dvd since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested freudian and <unk> analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once <unk> a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours it did n't help that an ill advised coffee and possession of a <unk> led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so.<br /><br />my only real issue with this is that zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with freudian themes he spends quite a bit of time on the films of hitchcock and david lynch not exactly masters of subtlety i would have liked"
